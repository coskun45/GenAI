## üìñ Code of Conduct

Please review our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which is in effect at all times. We expect everyone who contributes to this project to honor it.

## üîÅ Contributing via Pull Requests

1. [**Fork the repository**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo): Click on the [Fork](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/fork) button on the repository's page to create a copy of Kotaemon under your GitHub account.

2. [**Clone your code**](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository): Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

3. [**Create new branch**](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches-in-github-desktop): Create a new branch in your forked repo with a descriptive name that reflects your changes.

```sh
git checkout -b descriptive-name-for-your-changes
```

4. **Setup the development environment**: If you are working on the code, make sure to install the necessary dependencies for development

```sh
pip install -e "libs/kotaemon[dev]
```

5. **Make your changes**: Ensure your code follows the project's coding style and passes all test cases.

   - Check the coding style

   ```sh
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```

   - Run the tests

   ```sh
   pytest libs/kotaemon/tests/
   ```

6. [**Commit your changes**](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project-in-github-desktop): Once you are done with your changes, add and commit them with clear messages.

```sh
git add your_changes.py
git commit -m "clear message described your changes."
git push -u origin descriptive-name-for-your-changes
```

7. [**Create a pull request**](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request): When you are satisfied with your changes, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/compare) from your forked repository to Kotaemon repository. In the pull request, provide a clear description of your changes and any related issues. For the title of the pull request, please refer to our [commit messages convention](#-commit-messages).

8. **Wait for reviews**: Wait for the maintainers to review your pull request. If everything is okay, your changes will be merged into the Kotaemon project.

### GitHub Actions CI Tests

All pull requests must pass the [GitHub Actions Continuous Integration (CI)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/about-github-actions/about-continuous-integration-with-github-actions) tests before they can be merged. These tests include coding-style checks, PR title validation, unit tests, etc. to ensure that your changes meet the project's quality standards. Please review and fix any CI failures that arise.

## üì• Opening an Issue

Before [creating an issues](https://github.com/Cinnamon/kotaemon/issues/new/choose), search through existing issues to ensure you are not opening a duplicate. If you are reporting a bug or issue, please provide a reproducible example to help us quickly identify the problem.

## üìù Commit Messages

### Overview

We use [Angular convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/) for commit messages to maintain consistency and clarity in our project history. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with this convention before making your first commit.

_For the sake of simplicity, we use [squashing merge](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-commits) with pull requests. Therefore, if you contribute via a pull request, just make sure your PR's title, instead of the whole commits, follows this convention._

Commit format:

```sh
<gitmoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Examples:

```sh
docs(api): update api doc
```
